00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.822
At Cargill, we all know the
importance of keeping our plants

271e80df-ea24-49c0-b64e-af71bbb54756-1
00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:06.952
and facilities safe. But we
already closely follow

271e80df-ea24-49c0-b64e-af71bbb54756-2
00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:10.633
regulations. And we have plenty
of rules and regulations to

271e80df-ea24-49c0-b64e-af71bbb54756-3
00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.720
protect us from accidents,
right?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.898
Well, this is not simply about
following the law but having a

f876e605-8608-4b81-bbf4-354bd6d0ac16-1
00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:20.792
strong companywide foundation to
prevent hazardous processes from

f876e605-8608-4b81-bbf4-354bd6d0ac16-2
00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:21.560
causing harm.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.715
You're about to see how that
foundation is essential for

86701c76-3b6c-4e28-83a6-e2fe2b4efbd6-1
00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:26.800
everything we do.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880
This is Process Safety

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.485
She's an engineer who often
deals with hazardous processes

f85f3ebb-8752-45f0-bcfc-ed7b8834579d-1
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:37.200
at her plant.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.011
She works with materials and in
situations that have the

b55b783b-855f-4760-9288-34c1af3f1294-1
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.931
potential to put her team, the
community, or the environment in

b55b783b-855f-4760-9288-34c1af3f1294-2
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:45.360
danger.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.708
She knows that there must be a
management system in place to

0df0ed7a-e4a2-4595-b9b9-23a7fc2ac96a-1
00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:53.259
help handle risks such as
spills, explosions, or worse,

0df0ed7a-e4a2-4595-b9b9-23a7fc2ac96a-2
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.640
death.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.092
Cargill, as a company knows this
too, because we operate a number

c43cf282-2017-4bc1-b285-c3e593159123-1
00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:01.191
of complex processes all around
the world that have the

c43cf282-2017-4bc1-b285-c3e593159123-2
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.520
potential to cause harm.

15dd4625-12c4-40ec-9cd7-840c038ba098-0
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.842
Process safety management is the
system that helps prevent the

15dd4625-12c4-40ec-9cd7-840c038ba098-1
00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:10.564
releases of energy or chemicals
that can lead to injury, death

15dd4625-12c4-40ec-9cd7-840c038ba098-2
00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.159
or harm to the environment.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.529
Let's say we're dealing with a
large container of flammable

90f616e4-06b6-4e2e-a342-0bbb82276fc3-1
00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.640
liquids in an above ground
storage tank.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.244
Because it has the potential to
create a large fire or

36cc1019-0c8a-41ea-8688-fd58b82c32e2-1
00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:24.753
explosion, this process should
always be kept in control and

36cc1019-0c8a-41ea-8688-fd58b82c32e2-2
00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:26.480
completely contain the liquid.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.880
It will be safe and cause no
harm if we can be sure of this.

574a66c6-5281-4048-b351-d96e94d62319-0
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.191
Safeguards or layers of
protection are put into place to

574a66c6-5281-4048-b351-d96e94d62319-1
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:38.239
keep the process in control or
minimize the impact when it

574a66c6-5281-4048-b351-d96e94d62319-2
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.200
loses control.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.592
These can be procedures,
personal protective equipment,

210f0ab3-cc9a-4010-a444-c2e4800edaf7-1
00:01:42.592 --> 00:01:45.994
systems, or devices that are
designed specifically to prevent

210f0ab3-cc9a-4010-a444-c2e4800edaf7-2
00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:47.639
the escalation of the problem.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.143
In our example, these
preventative and mitigating

6a23861c-41a0-453a-b68d-23fc69f2c5e2-1
00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:53.440
barriers didn't just happen
overnight.

fa944898-6bed-4522-ac65-5091c6c4196e-0
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.440
They're developed and supported
by a management system that we

fa944898-6bed-4522-ac65-5091c6c4196e-1
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.945
follow. And our culture of
safety, which helps minimize our

fa944898-6bed-4522-ac65-5091c6c4196e-2
00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:02.640
risks in hazardous processes.

80cde35a-9019-4457-a7e0-016b8de3cb0e-0
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.582
These management systems
identify the hazards involved in

80cde35a-9019-4457-a7e0-016b8de3cb0e-1
00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:07.880
a particular process.

db54e584-8a79-4fc8-b8aa-360abd9f8ebe-0
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.291
From there, they evaluate the
risks, what could happen if

db54e584-8a79-4fc8-b8aa-360abd9f8ebe-1
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:12.440
something went wrong.

2fa5fd3f-c26a-41f8-8f58-8fe8096dd86d-0
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.040
Lastly, these systems control
risk to an acceptable level.

7c93b6d6-64f1-404c-9798-a34aa59a4035-0
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.562
Our management system contains
12 elements specifically created

7c93b6d6-64f1-404c-9798-a34aa59a4035-1
00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.880
to guide us as we create and
manage safe processes.

77a4ea81-5e70-4d55-b872-9e18a6b9aa28-0
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.430
These steps help us do things
like create safe work practices,

77a4ea81-5e70-4d55-b872-9e18a6b9aa28-1
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.230
investigate incidents, and
constantly be on the lookout for

77a4ea81-5e70-4d55-b872-9e18a6b9aa28-2
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.560
areas of improvement.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.019
As in our example with the tank
of flammable liquid, each

488d1d99-f1f9-4818-944f-8a6a96c5bb01-1
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.851
element weaves together for a
protective net against

488d1d99-f1f9-4818-944f-8a6a96c5bb01-2
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:41.920
catastrophic events.

043d5228-b4e3-4ce0-8b3f-169b180acb67-0
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.224
This management system is
incredibly important to our

043d5228-b4e3-4ce0-8b3f-169b180acb67-1
00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:48.605
culture of safety at Cargill,
and it's important to know that

043d5228-b4e3-4ce0-8b3f-169b180acb67-2
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:51.767
we need to follow it very
closely and consistently for it

043d5228-b4e3-4ce0-8b3f-169b180acb67-3
00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:52.640
to be effective.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.215
It's our responsibility to
ensure our employees,

503ebaf7-2645-4ff2-8a75-cf983a28766a-1
00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.840
communities, and environment
stay safe.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.753
A strong safety culture leads to
strong process safety management

7b7cfb37-d9bb-4f41-8110-70269d7c9d33-1
00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:07.474
practices. And strong process
safety management practices

7b7cfb37-d9bb-4f41-8110-70269d7c9d33-2
00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:09.720
protect us and everyone around
us.

ca2a641c-679f-4159-a589-7ae1da7de456-0
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.310
The quality of the safety
environment is directly related

ca2a641c-679f-4159-a589-7ae1da7de456-1
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.400
to our level of operational
discipline.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.280
Operational discipline is simply
doing what you say you will do.

c886dac6-cbb2-4faf-b083-2ecfdf73e595-0
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.792
Low operational discipline
creates an environment that's

c886dac6-cbb2-4faf-b083-2ecfdf73e595-1
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:25.446
bad for the overall safe
operation of hazardous

00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.655
Over time, low operational
discipline degrades the

10b6ac65-a4c1-4515-b93d-0182e8f89439-1
00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:33.449
management systems that provide
safeguards and the safety

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.000
systems become less and less
reliable.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.120
High operational discipline can
be established and maintained

5ba2f75f-49d8-48ef-90f6-b1d9b4a7d30c-1
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.953
with strong leadership, support,
knowledge of the process and its

00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:47.611
hazards, and knowledge of the
systems required to manage these

5ba2f75f-49d8-48ef-90f6-b1d9b4a7d30c-3
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:47.960
risks.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.238
It enables us to manage the many
risks in our facilities so that

d0d4f8a4-9019-476a-aeb2-6f8f36f4d2f4-1
00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:55.520
our people, our communities, and
our customers thrive.

d9af9ae7-12a8-4031-9a6d-149c3fad11c7-0
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.086
Haven knows that the stakes are
high, but our risk-based safety

d9af9ae7-12a8-4031-9a6d-149c3fad11c7-1
00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:01.760
culture helps keep us safe.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.299
We must always be vigilant and
keep this system in mind every

61903a01-a7fe-4aa6-a61a-06f4b17eb585-1
00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.120
step of the way.
